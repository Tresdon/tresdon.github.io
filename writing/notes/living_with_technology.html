                        <p>
                        Technology has been weaved into the fabric of our lives,
                        so we must figure out where it should
                        sit in this highest quilt - in preparation and hope that if
                        this thread pops loose it will not be the unraveling of
                        our entire work.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Examples of Technology</h2>
                        <p>
                        I will consider human-made devices technology: a
                        camera, a house, a trellis, money, government, and a quilt
                        are technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Hands, seeds, & rabbits are not technology.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Technology & Our Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                        Technology is a tool - meaning it should serve a purpose
                        toward a goal. This goal should be located outside of the
                        tool itself, less it is perverse development.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                        Goals which are accomplishable without human-made
                        technology are divinely blessed and naturally permitted;
                        with everything else we must be more careful to exercise
                        our power positively.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Technology & Communication</h2>
                        <p>For most, Technology sacrifices quality of communication
                        for quantity. For some, it enhances quality
                        (text-to-speech, braille). There is no moralism to
                        prescribe to this but we should be aware of the trade-off
                        we're making when we communicate via technology.
                        </p>
                               
                        <p>
                        Technology can confuse us into thinking there's an
                        opportunity to develop relationships later. Knowing this
                        to be false we must embrace others fully from the start.
                        </p>

                        </p>We must be most conscious and critical of the
                        communication technology that is made available to us.
                        </p>
                               
                        <p>
                        We should remember that text is inherently imbalanced -
                        Unlike a hug somebody always has the last word.
                        </p>
                               
                        <p>
                        In regards to social media we should consider heavily
                        before sharing directionless content (stories, posts,
                        photos) - since this content is not about our friends but
                        rather it is about us. We can only hope to keep our
                        friends with such anti-social behavior.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Technology & Our Health</h2>
                        <p>We are making some heavy sacrifices in the name of
                        technology & many of these have to do with our health.</p>

                        <p>We must remember that living longer does not mean a
                        healthier life.</p>

                        <p>Feed technology is an assault on our attention spans (TV
                        news, snapchat, facebook, etc). There is value in these
                        things but we should be suspicious if we find it in the
                        directionless feed of content.</p>

                        <p>We must remember that feed content is not at all
                        directionless, it's directed toward us - the product. It
                        is natural for this to fill us with disgust, shame, and
                        embarrassment.</p>

                        <p>We must remember that computers are representation at
                        best. The only literal fact of them is fast light.</p>

                        <p>A sedentary life is a passive life.</p>

                        <h2>In Praise of Low-Technology</h2>

                        <p>Low-tech lends itself to repair.</p>
                        <p>Low-tech is humble, doing a few things very well.</p>
                        <p>Low-tech can be sustainable.</p>
                        <p>Low-tech never needs to be charged.</p>

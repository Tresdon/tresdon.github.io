        <p>lets' talk a bit about the word "good"</p>

        <h2>an imposter adjective</h2>

        <p>
            I have some suspicions that "good", a word of supreme moralism, is in disguise as a harmless descriptive word. I believe this to be a widespread and dangerous category mistake, manifesting all those costs we know precipitate from such a mistake – namely throttling communication between people.
        </p>
        <p>
            if this isn't the case then I ask, what does the word "good" actually mean? And how can it be used  in regards to both breakfast and a basketball game? Does it mean the same thing when it is used here and there? What about when it's used to describe a beach ball or a beaker? Perhaps "good" is the word to describe that one attribute that all gripping books, sturdy shoes, and well-behaving dogs have in common? Now this is a word I feel I ought to know the meaning of!
        </p>
        <p>
            The certainly more generous (and possibly more correct) interpretation is that this is not a word which people think is truly descriptive, we only use it as a heuristic to description. We can infer that good in regards to breakfast means "delicious" and good in regards to a basketball game means "fun"; but this is where the chasm exists – what if by saying that my breakfast was good I mean that I ate outside on a pleasant day with my friend and I enjoyed the weather and the company. Or perhaps I found the food necessarily nutritious to help my hangover but I quite choked down every bite only in a bid for my future self. It certainly seems like we've stumbled upon some sort of communication sinkhole - now we must just be careful not to fall in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The curious part of this word to me is how some questions ask about widely different experiences, but this one word seems to always be in play. I wanna dig a little deeper and see if we can get to the bottom of what this word might be doing for or against us.
        </p>
        <h2>an uncaring lot</h2>

        <p>
            One argument that makes sense counter-thesis is that "good" is not a proper response, or even pretending to be one, but a pleasantry only. When folks reply that they are "good", they are really just obeying some socio-lingual rule for appropriate interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand the idea of pleasantries and can even bring myself to see them as beneficial but what I am concerned by is that our ready-response of "good" seems to make anything and everything a pleasantry due to how vague it is. Saying that something was "good" seems to have become synonymous with saying "I don't wanna talk about it" and that is dangerous because something being vaguely "good" seems like a worthwhile topic to delve further into instead of the finality of a discussion.
        </p>

        <h2>language and culture at play</h2>

        <p>
            It seems we may have language to blame for this because we certainly don't have any individuals. In America "good" can be used to reply to such a wide variety of questions but one language should not speak for all of them. To give instance, in Japanese this vanilla form of good is not usually used in the same, commonplace way.</p>
        <p>
            You may hear somebody ask どうですか？ or literally, "how is it / how are you?". The most common responses to this are adjectives like 嬉しい (happy)、美味しい (delicious)、 楽しい (fun)、 but not usually bare naked いい (good). Although the response is valid it would be a bit of cause for confusion. It's not the case that there are no fixed pleasantries in Japanese, but to get to that same conversation there's a different, more specific question. You may be asked  お元気ですか？ — prompting a response about your health. The common response to this is 元気です、a parroting of the question minus a couple syllables to affirm your vigor. So then this is a Japanese pleasantry perhaps, but it seems a fortunate use of language to not let the word "good" become one that morphs so easily into whatever space it finds itself in. When somebody asks "how are you?" There are a potentially limitless number of responses and good is rarely an appropriate word unless you were just adopting orphans or sheltering the homeless since good is a moralistic word at the end of the day.
        </p>
        <h2>holding relative views</h2>
        <p>
            The word "good" concedes reality to others silently, a potentially understated danger. The word "good" only allows the retention of relative reality among people. There can be no ground truth or agreement when "good" is said. A fair objection here is that this seems to be the case with all words — what I think of as tasty may be different than what you think of as tasty but at least we both know it's something about the mouth and a pleasant sensation there. This means perhaps "good" just commits the same crime at larger magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue is because it creates - and gives validity to - a sort of relativism where everybody has their own idea of what "good" is and so by using it we are essentially just passing the buck and letting the other person maintain their own idea of "good" no matter whether or not it's really valid. Little communication can be had by the word good because it requires summoning what "good" looks like for that person _experientially_ — an acrobatic act of empath.
        </p>

        <h2>"good" as gavel</h2>

        <p>It's hard to use this infamous word and to not simultaneously be aligning with some sort of judgement. Due to it being a moralistic word at the end of the day, when we use it we are permitting its target to be in the world alongside us and even celebrating their company. We judge all sorts of things throughout our day, some with more gravity than others and some more exhaustively than others but it is important that we as the procurator are certain about the judgements we make. Good is such a clandestine judgement which means that it blindly bolsters entire rhetoric.</p>

        <h2>conclusion</h2>
        <p>I am starting to suspect this word "good" a devilish one; although it eagerly claims the opposite. It seems to be evaporating the communicative content from our conversation. A wicked combination of obscurity and acceptability leads us to use an empty word so often.</p>
        <p>Perhaps using "good" is not communication but rather just a façade of such.  It seems unfortunate to me that we've wound up with this as our common pleasantry.</p>

            The United States election is exactly two days from the time I am writing this post. It seems like it's been
            a year that the only news related to the presidential candidates matters. In the timespan though things have
            happened all over the world from the
            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/asia/thai-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies/"> 70 year reign of the king
                of Thailand coming to an end,</a> to
            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/europe/italy-rome-mayor-virginia-raggi/"> Rome electing
                its first female mayor,</a> and who can forget <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887">Britain's
            decision to leave the European Union.</a> The two main party candidates will not be discussed in this
            discourse as there's been enough talk of them for a lifetime. What this will explore is the constant dismissal and
            belittling of others opinions that has been rampant in this election and why that is a
            poignantly and frighteningly un-American aspect of this election.
        </p>

        <p>
            Spend any amount of time on the internet and you will see the constant barrage of people calling others who
            support their opposing party ignorant, evil, and anti-american. This occurs in every election, because many
            people have the tendency to believe that they are standing on the correct side of an issue or a decision.
            If people thought they were wrong then they would flip to the other side of the issue and think they are
            correct.

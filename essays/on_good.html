        <h2>an imposter adjective</h2>

        <p>The word "good" is in disguise as a proper descriptive word. This is a widespread category mistake, manifesting all those costs we know precipitate from such a mistake, such as less effective communication.</p>
        <p>if this isn't the case then I ask, well what does the word "good" identify in a description? And how it be used  in regards to both a breakfast and a basketball game? when it is used here and there, does it mean the same thing? what about the other things that can be described as good? how about a beach ball and a beaker? does that mean "good" is the word to describe that one attribute that all pleasant rivers, shoes, and well-behaving dogs have in common? now this is a word I feel I ought to know the meaning of!</p>
        <p>the certainly more generous (and possibly more correct) interpretation is that this is not a word which people think is truly descriptive, we only use it as a heuristic to description. We can infer that good in regards to breakfast means "delicious" and good in regards to a basketball game means "fun; but this is where the chasm exists – what if by stating that my breakfast was good I mean that I ate outside on a pleasant day with my friend and I enjoyed that. Or perhaps I found the food necessarily nutritious to help my hangover but I quite choked down every bite only in a bid for my future self. This certainly sounds like the kind of communication sinkhole which comes from making such a mistake.</p>
        <p>The curious part of this to me is how for questions ask about widely different experiences, this one word seems to always be in play. I wanna take a bit closer look at what this word might be doing for us.</p>

        <h2>an uncaring lot</h2>

        <p>One argument that makes sense counter-thesis is that "good" is not a proper response, or even pretending to be one, but a pleasantry only. When folks reply that they are "good", they are really just obeying some socio-lingual rule for appropriate interaction.</p>
        <p>I understand the idea of pleasantries and can even bring myself to see them as beneficial but what I am concerned by is that our ready-response of "good" seems to make anything and everything a pleasantry due to how vague it is. Saying that something was "good" seems to have become synonymous with saying "I don't wanna talk about it" and that is dangerous because something being vaguely "good" seems like a worthwhile topic to delve further into instead of a finality of the event.</p>

        <h2>language and culture at play</h2>

        <p>It's worth noting that our language is to blame for this, not the people. In American English good can be used to reply to such a wide variety of questions but one language should not speak for all of them. To give instance, in Japanese this vanilla form of good is not usually used in the same, commonplace way.</p>
        <p>You may hear somebody ask どうですか？ or literally, "how is it / how are you?". The most common responses to this are adjectives like 嬉しい (happy)、美味しい (delicious)、 楽しい (fun)、 but not usually bare naked いい (good). Although the response is valid it would be a bit of cause for confusion. It's not the case that there are no fixed pleasantries in Japanese, but to get to that same conversation there's a different, more specific question. You may be asked  お元気ですか？ — or prompting a response about your health. The common response to this is 元気です、or a parroting of the question minus a couple syllables to affirm your vigor. So then this is a Japanese pleasantry perhaps, but it seems a fortunate use of language to not let the word "good" become one that morphs so easily into whatever space it finds itself in. When somebody asks "how are you?" There are a potentially limitless number of responses and good is rarely an appropriate word unless you were just adopting orphans or sheltering the homeless – good is a moralistic word at the end of the day.</p>

        <h2>holding relative views</h2>
        <p>The word "good" concedes reality to others silently, a potentially understated danger. The word "good" only allows the retention of relative reality among people. There can be no ground truth or agreement when "good" is said. A fair objection here is that this seems to be the case with all words — what I think of as tasty may be different than what you think of as tasty but at least we both know it's something about the mouth and a pleasant sensation there. This means perhaps "good" just commits the same crime at larger magnitude. </p>
        <p>The issue is because it creates - and gives validity to - this sort of relativism where everybody has their own idea of what "good" is and so by using it we are essentially just passing the buck and so we let the other person maintain their own idea of "good" no matter whether or not it's really valid. No communication can be had by the word good because it requires summoning what "good" looks like for that person _experientially_ — a non-trivial act of acrobatic empath. </p>

        <h2>judging</h2>

        <p>People wield the word good as gavel. It's a hard word to use and to not simultaneously be aligning with a judgement. </p>

        <h2>conclusion</h2>
        <p>I am starting to suspect this word "good" a devilish one; although it eagerly claims opposite. It seems to be evaporating the communicative content from our conversation. Through a wicked combination of obscurity and acceptability, we find ourselves using a word which says so little, so often.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure that using "good" is communication but sometimes just a façade of such.</p>

        <h2>an imposter adjective</h2>

        <p>
            I'm starting to feel cheated by the word "good". This is one of the most pervasive words in American English, with it and its cousins being used in reply to any question of experience :

            "How was your trip?", "It was great! Thanks for asking :)"
            "How did the basketball game go?" - "Pretty good, I didn't break an ankle!"
            "How's your slice of pizza?" - "Oh, not bad"

            The puzzling part of this to me is how the questions ask about widely different experiences but somehow the response is always the same. I find this to be a bit of tragedy because when a word can mean so many things it starts to mean nothing. I am becoming worried that the word good is monopolizing our adjective space and that it starves a lot of conversation of communicative content.

        <h2>an uncaring lot</h2>

        <p>
           I've let some others know about my growing suspicion of this word and gathered some opinions about it. Many people I've spoken with explain it away as a pleasantry like "Well, that's just something people say. When people ask how you're doing they don't really care." To which I ask "Does that thought not fill you with dread? That people don't care how you feel?" Most people flash a hiccup of thought before shrugging and conceding "That's just how it is."

These interactions have lead me to some interesting realizations. I understand the idea of pleasantries and can even bring myself to see them as beneficial but what I am concerned by is that our ready-response of "good" seems to make anything and everything a pleasantry due to how vague it is. Saying that something was "good" seems to have become synonymous with saying "I don't wanna talk about it" and that is dangerous because something going vaguely "good" seems like a worthwhile topic to delve further into.

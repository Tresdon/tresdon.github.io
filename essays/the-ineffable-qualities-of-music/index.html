            Music is something that many people listen to for many different reasons. Some people listen to music for
            most of the time they are awake, some people listen to music at the gym to enhance their workout, and some
            people listen to music when they're sad because it's cathartic. Personally I listen to music all of the time
            I can get away with it. The thing that all of these situations have in common is that people have a tendency
            to enhance whatever they're currently doing. Sometimes music is listened to intently (such as at concerts
            or just chilling out on your bed listening to your favorite band's new album) but for most of the
            general public, music is listened to as a backdrop to their current activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="emphasize">What does this make music then?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            If one isn't listening to the music for the music itself but rather to complement whatever they're doing
            then that sounds like people use music as a tool. But is music one broad tool? Surely there's been enough of
            Pachelbel's Canon in D at weddings, but this seems much more fitting (for most weddings) than playing
            any amount of raw, high-octane Death Grips at a wedding. On the other hand it seems like Canon in D might not give
            the motivation that one needs to complete a workout, but Death Grips might lend itself to that rather nicely.
        </p>

        <p>
            None of this is particularly elucidating, as most of us would recognize how one type of music complements
            certain types of events effectively. The thing I think that is important though is the explicit
            realization that for many people choosing what music to listen to is simply finding the proper
            <span class="emphasize">ambience pairing.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            How then does one choose what to music to use for their particular setting? I think many people would
            agree that people look for music that pushes them to feel a certain way. It's hard to not feel blissful
            listening to Canon in D and aggressive when listening to Death Grips.

            Music is something that many people listen to for many different reasons. Some people listen to music for
            most of the time they are awake, some people listen to music at the gym to enhance their workout, and some
            people listen to music when they're sad because it's cathartic. Personally I listen to music all of the time
            I can get away with it. The thing that all of these situations have in common is that people have a tendency
            to enhance whatever they're currently doing. Sometimes music is listened to intently (such as at concerts
            or just chilling out on your bed listening to your favorite band's new album) but for most of the
            general public, music is listened to as a backdrop to their current activity.

            What does this make music then?
        </p>

        <p>
            If one isn't listening to the music for the music itself but rather to complement whatever they're doing
            then that sounds like people use music as a tool.

            The United States election is exactly two days from the time I am typing this out. It seems like it's been
            a year that the only news that has crossed my eyes has been related to the presidential candidates.
            In the timespan though things have happened all over the world from the
            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/asia/thai-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies/"> 70 year reign of the king
                of Thailand coming to an end,</a> to
            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/europe/italy-rome-mayor-virginia-raggi/"> Rome electing
                its first female mayor,</a> and who can forget <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887">Britain's
            decision to leave the European Union.</a> The two main party candidates will not be discussed in this
            discourse as there's been enough talk of them for a lifetime. What this will explore is the constant dismissal and
            belittling of others opinions that has been rampant in this election and why it is a
            poignantly and frighteningly un-American aspect of this election.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you spend any amount of time on the internet and you will see the constant barrage of people calling
            others who oppose their candidate ignorant, evil, and anti-american. This occurs in every election, because many
            people have the tendency to believe that they are standing on the correct side of an issue or a decision.
            If people thought they were wrong then they would flip to the other side of the issue and then they would
            think they are correct. In the end what this comes down to is that one side or person thinks that they
            understand the issue at a more fundamental level than an opponent. The important thing to remember is
            that there is rarely an argument made that has no footing or rationale behind it at all, and the even more
            important thing to remember is that for some problems there isn't one best way to do everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reality is, for a large number of policies it is likely to help some group and be detrimental to another group.
            This isn't always the case but it's certainly the trend, especially when it comes to economic policies. In
            a time like this I think the most dangerous thing that the citizens of this country can do is to not
            recognize the complexity that is behind these issues. We need to take the responsibility of recognizing that
            the answers aren't clear cut and one proposed solution doesn't necessarily work for everybody. When somebody
            is accusing another of being ignorant and just dismissing their opinion it leads to a lack of attempted
            empathy for another individual. If there's any thing that we should do to build a stronger community it's to
            listen to each other. We need to take responsibility for gaining a fuller understanding of how all citizens
            in our society live and to attempt to understand why they believe the things they do. Only this will help
            us craft better policies, strive toward equality, and become more compassionate individuals.
